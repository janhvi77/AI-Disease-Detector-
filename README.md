🤖 AI Disease Detector

A console-based intelligent disease predictor written in simple C language. This program acts as an AI assistant that interacts with the user by asking a series of yes/no questions related to common symptoms and then intelligently predicts the most likely disease such as Dengue, Malaria, or Typhoid.


---

📌 Description

The AI Disease Detector is a beginner-friendly yet smart program that simulates an AI health assistant. It collects responses to 10 health-related questions and analyzes the symptoms to provide a likely diagnosis.

It demonstrates:

Basic C logic and conditionals

Realistic health-related symptom analysis

User-friendly console interface

Simulated progress/animation effect

Basic use of ANSI colors to make it visually engaging



---

🔧 Technologies Used

✅ C Programming Language

✅ Standard C Libraries (stdio.h, stdlib.h)

✅ ANSI escape codes (for color formatting in supported terminals)



---

🎯 Features

✅ 10 yes/no symptom-based questions

✅ Intelligent matching using counters

✅ Suggests likely diseases: Dengue, Malaria, or Typhoid

✅ Real-time simulated analysis with delay

✅ Clean and clear ASCII formatting

✅ Basic use of colored text (in compatible terminals)
